BroadcastReceiver and BroadcastSender (Broadcast Communication using UDP):

In the BroadcastReceiver class, the program listens for a broadcast message on a specific port (12345). 
It creates a DatagramSocket to receive the broadcasted message and prints the received message to the 
console. On the sender side, the BroadcastSender class creates a DatagramSocket and sends a broadcast 
message to all devices on the network using the broadcast IP address (255.255.255.255) and the same port 
(12345). Both classes demonstrate broadcasting where a message is sent from one sender to multiple 
receivers within the same network.

MulticastReceiver and MulticastSender (Multicast Communication using UDP):

The MulticastReceiver class listens for multicast messages sent to a specific multicast group address (224.0.0.1) 
and port number (12345). It joins the multicast group, receives a message using a MulticastSocket, and prints the
received message to the console. The MulticastSender class sends a multicast message to the same multicast group 
address and port using a MulticastSocket. Both classes demonstrate multicast communication, where a message is 
sent from one sender to multiple receivers who have joined the specific multicast group.

UnicastReceiver and UnicastSender (Unicast Communication using TCP):

In the UnicastReceiver class, the program creates a ServerSocket and listens for incoming connections on port 12345. 
When a connection is established, it reads a message sent by the UnicastSender. The UnicastSender class creates a 
Socket and connects to the receiver's IP address (localhost in this case) and port number 12345. It sends a message 
("Gotcha ...") to the receiver using an OutputStream and a PrintWriter. Both classes demonstrate unicast communication, 
where messages are sent between a specific sender and receiver using TCP sockets.

BroadcastReceiver and BroadcastSender showcase broadcasting messages to multiple devices within the same network using UDP. 
The MulticastReceiver and MulticastSender demonstrate multicast communication, where messages are 
sent to multiple devices that have joined a specific multicast group address. Lastly, the UnicastReceiver and UnicastSender
exemplify unicast communication, where messages are exchanged between a specific sender and receiver using TCP sockets, 
ensuring direct communication between two networked entities.
