The first code snippet, ReadStream, reads data from a file named "01.txt" using a BufferedInputStream.
It reads the file in chunks of 5 bytes at a time and prints the content of each chunk as a string. 
It also calculates and displays the remaining bytes in the file as it reads through the content. 
If there are more than 5 bytes in the file, it will read the next 5 bytes, and so on, until the entire file is read. 
The second code snippet, WriteStream, writes a specific string ("Hii. My Name is AswarMhd.") 
to the same file, "01.txt", using a FileOutputStream and an OutputStreamWriter. 
It first creates an output stream to the file and then writes the specified string to the file. 
After writing the content, it closes the output stream. 
In summary, ReadStream is for reading data from a file, and WriteStream is for writing specific content to the same file.
