The first two codes are (Clint.java, ClientHandler.java) part of a simple client-server communication system using sockets in Java. 
In the Client class, a client connects to a server (assuming the server is running on localhost at 
port 8000) and reads a message sent by the server. It establishes a socket connection, reads the 
server's response using input streams, and prints the response to the console. The ClientHandler 
class implements the Runnable interface and defines the behavior for handling client connections 
on the server side. When a client connects, the server creates a ClientHandler object in a separate thread. 
The ClientHandler class sends a message to the connected client and then closes the connection. 
This approach allows the server to handle multiple clients concurrently, with each client being processed 
in its own thread.

In the Server class, a server socket is created and set to listen on port 8000. 
When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and starts a ClientHandler 
thread for that client. Additionally, the ServerHandler class implements the Runnable interface and defines 
a simple message that the server prints when the server thread is run. However, in the provided code, 
the ServerHandler class is not utilized or integrated into the server logic. The Server class demonstrates 
the server's ability to handle multiple client connections by spawning individual threads for each client, 
allowing concurrent communication with multiple clients. The Client and ClientHandler together establish 
client-server communication, and the Server class orchestrates and manages these connections efficiently 
using multithreading.
