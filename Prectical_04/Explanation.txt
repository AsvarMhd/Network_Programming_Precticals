URIManipulationExample: URI Manipulation

In the first code snippet, URIManipulationExample, the program demonstrates 
how to work with URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) in Java. 
It starts by creating a URI object from a given URI string. 
It then modifies the URI by resolving a relative path against the base URI using the resolve() method. 
The modified URI is printed to the console. Next, 
it creates a new URI using various components like scheme, host, path, query, and fragment. 
The new URI is created and printed. 
This example illustrates basic URI manipulation, including resolution of relative URIs and 
creation of new URIs with specific components.

URIPassingExample: URI Component Extraction

In the second code snippet, URIPassingExample, the program demonstrates how to extract different components from a URI. 
It creates a URI object from a given URI string and then prints 
out specific components such as scheme, host, path, query, and fragment using the corresponding get 
methods provided by the URI class. 
This example shows how to retrieve individual components from a URI for further processing or analysis.

URLConnectionReader: Reading Web Content Using URLConnection

In the third code snippet, URLConnectionReader, the program demonstrates 
how to read web content from a URL using URLConnection. 
It creates a URL object representing a webpage and opens a connection to that URL using openConnection(). 
It then reads the content of the webpage using a BufferedReader after obtaining an InputStream from the URLConnection. 
The program prints each line of the webpage to the console. 
This example showcases how to establish a connection to a webpage, obtain an input stream, and read its content
line by line.

URLReaderProgram: Reading Web Content Using URL

In the fourth code snippet, URLReaderProgram, the program also reads web content, but in this case, 
it directly uses the openStream() method of the URL class to obtain an InputStream. 
It then creates an InputStreamReader and a BufferedReader to read the content line by line. 
The program demonstrates an alternative way to read web content using a simpler approach, 
directly retrieving the input stream from the URL object. It prints the lines of the webpage to the console. 
This example illustrates a straightforward method to read web content without using URLConnection.
